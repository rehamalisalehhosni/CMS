## **Installation:** ##
####Download####
Use composer to download the package into your project.

     composer require kevupton/ethereal

####Setup####
Then add the `Kevupton\Ethereal\Providers\EtherealServiceProvider` class to your `app.php` config file under `providers`

```php
    'providers' => [
    
        /*
         * Laravel Framework Service Providers...
         * Place at the end of the array
         */
    
        Kevupton\Ethereal\Providers\EtherealServiceProvider::class,
    
    ],
```


There are currently no config or migrations, so there is no need to `vendor:publish`.

####Basic Usage####

Just extend the `Kevupton\Ethereal\Models\Ethereal` class instead of Laravel Model class, for each of your models you want Ethereal functionality. 

```php
    <?php namespace My\Namespace\Location;

    use Kevupton\Ethereal\Models\Ethereal;

    class Example extends Ethereal { }
```
